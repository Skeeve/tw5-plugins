! Introduction

The ''action-increment'' widget is an [[action widget|https://tiddlywiki.com/#ActionWidgets]] that retrieves a value from a text reference. It will then increase the first digit-sequence found in that text and store it.

For more information, please see the {{online documentation#action-increment Plugin||$:/Documentation}}.
